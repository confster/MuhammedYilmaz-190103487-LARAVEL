        'blogtext2'=>'Thunberg initially attracted attention for her youth and her direct manner of speaking both in public and in front of political leaders and gatherings, in which she criticizes world leaders for their failure to do what she believes is sufficient to address the climate crisis. Thunbergs activism began after her parents convinced her to choose multiple lifestyle choices to reduce her carbon footprint. In August 2018, at the age of 15, she began spending school days outside the Swedish parliament to call for more action on climate change by holding up a sign that read Skolstrejk fรถr klimatet (School strike for climate). Soon, other students began similar protests in their communities. Together they organized a school climate strike called "Fridays for the Future." Since Thunbergs speech at the 2018 UN Climate Change Conference, student strikes have taken place every week somewhere in the world. In 2019, several coordinated protests took place in several cities, each with more than a million students. To avoid flying, Thunberg traveled to North America, where she attended the 2019 UN Climate Change Summit. Her performance there, in which she exclaimed, "How dare you?", Was widely taken up by the press and incorporated into the music. Her sudden rise to worldwide fame made her a leader [9] and a target for critics. Her influence on the world stage has been described by The Guardian and other newspapers as the "Greta Effect." She has received numerous awards and accolades, including Honorary Membership of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society, Time Magazines 100 Most Influential People, Times Youngest Person of the Year, Forbes 100 Most Influential Women in the World (2019 ). and two consecutive Nobel Peace Prize nominations (2019 and 2020).'
